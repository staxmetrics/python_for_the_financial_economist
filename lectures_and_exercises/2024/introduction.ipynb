    "## Course objective <a class=\"anchor\" id='CourseObj'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this course is to enable students to implement financial models using realistic data. Several topics in financial economics will be covered and the students will at the end of the course be able to independently implement financial models from scratch in Python. This will be highly relevant when writing academic papers (master thesis) and/or working in the financial industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The students will learn Python by solving a range of different problems in financial economics. This includes implementation of different models from academic research papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "My hope is to help students prepare for the often tedious programming tasks involved when writing their master theses. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exam <a class=\"anchor\" id='Exam'></a> \n",
    "\n",
    "The exam will consist of a two week project where students apply the coding skill and financial knowledge learned in the course  to a specific problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Format:__ Group take-home assignment. 2 students per group (max 25 pages). Students are allowed to hand-in individually (max 15 pages). \n",
    "\n",
    "__Duration:__ 14 days. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Subject:__ The learning objectives of the course is to _\"use Python and the methods used in the course-exercises to solve problems similar or slightly different from the problems solved in the exercises of the course.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "The exam may be formulated as a set of specific problems, replication of a scientific paper or a more broad project on a particular topic discussed in the course. Previous exams are available in the [github repository](https://github.com/staxmetrics/python_for_the_financial_economist). "
